# Introduction
As said in the descrption, this is my first project on github. 
I'm a student in a computer science degree, this is my first time working on a project alone.
I've had a class called "Client-Server Architecture" where we saw a little bit of html, css and javascript but it was hard and not beginner friendly.
So this year, i decided to try it on my own and i loved it!
I had to read a lot of documentation on the site https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/ to try and learn css and javascript.

# How to implement it
You just have to download the files, and open index.html!
The code may not be perfect but that's just a start.
Don't hesitate to tell me what i can improve! I want feedbacks!

# How i did it
Well at first i just did the html because that's what i knew.
Then i went on canvas and did the whole visual: what buttons i wanted to have, the colors of the interface etc.
Then i did all the css to match my prototype (it was very hard) and wrote the javascript. I did use an ia to help me with some of my errors but it was mostly me. It's a tool and i was learning.

I hope you like it! :)
